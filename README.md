## Abstract

This little React app was a take-home assignment from Turing School of Software & Design; a chance to meet a spec within a short period of time as practice scoping, designing, and executing a project in just a day or two. (You can read the spec [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe), if you're interested!) It pulls stories and information from the New York Times' [Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview), provides a "detail view" for headlines you click on, and offers a link to the NYT's website to read the full stories. It also lets you sort stories by section!
